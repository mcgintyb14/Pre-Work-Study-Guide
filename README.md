# Pre-Work-Study-Guide Webpage

## Description

To create an easily digestible study guide for Bootcamp students, I created this web page and associated repository which contains key notes of the four main topics we have covered in the Prework: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Through doing this, I have provided a single page of reference for Bootcamp students to easily find key notes without having to look back through modules or personal notes on their desktop. 

From my work on this project, I learned a lot about web development and how to build a web page from scratch, starting withg HTML code to build the "foundation" of your web page; followed with "CSS" to determine the style of the webpage and its contents; lastly, I learned how JavScript can also be linked to the HTML file to provide interactivity for the website. 

On top of what I learned about the basics of the above three languages, I also learned the importance of the Git worflow. This was demonstrated throughout the length of this project by ensuring that the project was broken down into more digestible parts (i.e., "Issues") that we stored on my Github profile. In addition, I learned how to create "feature branches" off the main branch of my code so that I can create, edit, and test new code before merging it into my main branch.
